# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) working in this repository: the
**DarkEden** game server, an MMORPG server written in C++20 and split into
three cooperating processes.

## Rules and the tests that own them

Every architectural rule below is owned by something that fails, never by a
memory. The full ratchet table (R1–R18), with the command that measures each
number and the reason it exists, is in `docs/RESTRUCTURING.md`;
`tests/ratchet/ratchets.sh` is the enforcing copy, run by ctest as `ratchets`.

| Rule | Owner | What fails when it is broken |
|------|-------|------------------------------|
| A packet's bytes never change silently | the golden fixtures in `tests/golden/`, compared by `wire_tests` | a byte diff in the golden — a protocol change the client repo must ship identically |
| Every factory's packet id, name and max body size stay as inventoried | `tests/wire_layout_test.cpp` against `tests/wire-layout.txt` | the inventory diff (`tests/tools/wire_inventory_diff.sh` cross-checks the client's copy) |
| A packet that touches the encrypter is pinned at codes 0..5 | `ratchets.sh`, looking for `tests/golden/<Name>.code5.hex` | "packets use the encrypter but have no per-code goldens"; exceptions live in `tests/ratchet/encrypter_exceptions.txt` |
| Each server registers exactly the factories it registered before | `tests/tools/factory_registrations.pl` vs `tests/ratchet/factory_registrations.txt`, run by `ratchets.sh` | a membership diff, on an add **or** a drop |
| `tests/generated/AllPacketFactories.inc` matches the kernel membership | `ratchets.sh` re-runs `tests/tools/gen_factory_list.sh` and diffs | "AllPacketFactories.inc is stale" |
| A kernel file includes only kernel files and mentions no server-type macro or `__COMBAT__` (K1/K2/K3); a core file includes no MySQL, Lua or socket-transport header (C1, shrink-only baseline in `tests/arch/baseline.txt`); `src/domain/` quote-includes only domain headers (D1) | `tests/arch/check_includes.pl`, ctest `arch_includes` | the offending include or macro, named |
| Packets carry no `execute()` — handlers register at the composition root | ratchet R4 | R4 above 0 |
| No `executeQuery` outside `src/server/database/` and the `repository/` directories | ratchets R2/R3 | R2/R3 above 0 |
| A critical section is never unlocked by hand | `tests/tools/critical_section_audit.pl`, ctest `critical_section_audit` | the file and line of the hand-written `unlock()` |
| Zone-group state is touched only under that group's mutex | `ZoneGroup::assertOwned()` under `DE_OWNERSHIP_CHECKS` (Debug builds only) | `abort()` at the gateway |
| Every seed `Player` row ships a current argon2id hash | `tests/password_hash_test.cpp`, which reads `initdb/DARKEDEN.sql` | the seed account missing from the test's password map |
| Every `initdb/` table is InnoDB in `utf8mb4` / `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` | `ratchets.sh` | the table, named |
| Every `src/**/*.cpp` is compiled by some target, every header is included | ratchets R15/R16 | the dead file, listed |
| Repository SQL behaves against a real MySQL | `make integration-test` (`tests/integration/`, needs docker) | the failing statement |

## Working in this repository

- **The loop.** `make dev-test` builds the suite in the container and runs
  all of ctest; `make test` does the same with a local C++20-capable
  compiler *and library*. Run one before every push. The C++20 workflow
  (`.github/workflows/cpp20.yml`) runs the suite and the production builds
  only on master pushes/merges — feature branches are verified locally, to
  conserve Actions minutes.
- **Ratchet numbers only go down.** `ratchets.sh` fails in both directions:
  above the baseline is new debt, below it is progress nobody wrote down.
  When a number drops, tighten it in `tests/ratchet/ratchets.sh` **and** in
  `docs/RESTRUCTURING.md` in the same commit. Every baseline comes from
  running its command, never from an estimate.
- **Task status lines.** `docs/RESTRUCTURING.md` is the living restructuring
  plan. Each task has a checkbox and a `> **Status:**` line — `not started` |
  `in progress (<what remains>)` | `done (<commit>)` | `dropped (<why>)` —
  updated in the same commit as the work it describes. It records the current
  state and what the next reader needs to act (conventions, open bugs, what
  remains); the narrative of a change belongs in its PR description and
  commit message. A task is `done` only once its **Owner** exists — the test
  or mechanism that keeps the rule true from then on.
- **Bugs found while restructuring** are recorded in `docs/FIXES.md` with the
  same status convention rather than fixed silently.
- **A failing golden or inventory diff is a protocol change**, not a test to
  silence. The client repo keeps hand-maintained copies of every packet
  class; ship the identical change there and link the two commits. Re-record
  deliberately: `UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 ./bin/wire_tests`.

## Build Commands

### Building the project

```bash
make            # Debug build (default)
make debug      # same as `make`
make release    # Release build
make clean      # remove build/, bin/, lib/
```

The project uses CMake; the Makefile wraps it. `make` / `make debug`
configures with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`, `make release` with `Release`;
both build with tests off (`-DDARKEDEN_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`). Binaries go to
`bin/`, libraries to `lib/`. For development, always choose the debug build:
`DE_OWNERSHIP_CHECKS` is armed only there. `Assert` and `__BEGIN_TRY` stay
live in every configuration, because `NDEBUG` is never defined.

### Code formatting

```bash
make fmt            # format all C++ code under src/ and tests/
make fmt-check      # check the files you modified (fast)
make fmt-check-all  # check every file (slow)
```

The project uses clang-format with a `.clang-format` configuration file.
- Format checking runs via GitHub Actions only on pushes/merges to master
  (`.github/workflows/format-check.yml`), on the files changed since the
  previous master tip, using whatever clang-format `ubuntu-latest` installs
  (18.x as of 2026-08).
- **Do not run bare `make fmt` before committing — the tree is not v18-clean.**
  Most of `src/` was formatted with an older clang-format, so `make fmt`
  reformats files you never touched and buries your diff in unrelated churn.
  Format only what you touched:
  ```bash
  git diff --name-only master HEAD | grep -E '\.(cpp|h|hpp)$' | xargs clang-format -i
  ```
- Touching a file that was never v18-formatted makes CI demand you reformat
  it. That is expected; the reformat lands in your PR.
- `make fmt` / `fmt-check-all` cover `src/` **and** `tests/`, matching CI.

### Tests

```bash
make test              # build and run the suite with a local C++20 compiler
make dev-test          # same suite, built in the container off a local
                       # workspace. On a Windows host, this is the one to use.
make integration-test  # MySQL-backed repository tier (throwaway MySQL 5.7 +
                       # initdb/ schema + the real MySQL*Repository impls).
                       # Needs docker + the darkeden-dev image.
```

Prefer the pinned Zig container. Ubuntu 20.04's distro GCC 9 lacks the
required library facilities; CMake checks `jthread`, `stop_token` and
stop-aware condition-variable waits at configure time.

Beyond the rules table above: the suite (in `tests/`) carries golden byte
fixtures and loopback round-trips for most registered packet factories (the
wire-layout inventory covers all 465, the goldens 451), and
`tests/password_hash_test.cpp` pins the loginserver's argon2id hashing
(`src/server/loginserver/PasswordHash.cpp`) against upstream argon2's own
vectors. The whole packet set is compiled once, macro-free, in the
`de-kernel` library — the same archive the deployed servers and the tests
link; membership is `tests/arch/kernel_files.txt`, and `TestPackets` is only
the define-free factory/validator trio on top of it. Kernel files may not
mention server-type macros or `__COMBAT__` (K2), so the wire layer stays
buildable — and identical — alone. (This is not the client's config, which
defines `__GAME_CLIENT__=1`.)

#### Building in the container

**Do not compile straight off the bind-mounted checkout.** Measured inside
the container, the Windows mount costs ~160x on `stat` and ~145x on reads
versus the container's own filesystem, and since every translation unit opens
dozens of headers the build becomes I/O bound: a full build took ~20 minutes
at ~20% CPU on 8 cores. `tools/devbuild.sh` syncs the build *inputs*
(`cmake/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `third_party/`, `data/`, `initdb/`,
`docker/start.sh` and the top-level CMakeLists/Makefile) into a container
volume, builds there with Ninja and ccache, and copies only generated test
data back (`tests/golden/`, `tests/generated/`, `tests/wire-layout.txt`).
Same build: **~3.5 minutes at ~95% CPU**, and a no-op rebuild in seconds.

```bash
make dev-test                          # build wire_tests + ctest
bash tools/devbuild.sh test --record   # re-record goldens, then run
make dev-build                         # all production targets
make dev-shell                         # shell in the workspace
make dev-clean                         # drop the workspace + cache volumes
```

Needs the image once: `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t darkeden-dev .`.
It pins Zig 0.16.0 (Clang 21.1.0) and carries Ninja, ccache and rsync.
Artifacts live in compiler/target/build-type-specific directories in the
volume, so `bin/` and `lib/` in the checkout are **not** updated by these
targets; `bash tools/devbuild.sh output-dir` prints the artifact root. Two
concurrent checkouts (git worktrees) sharing one workspace volume race the
script's `rsync --delete`: give each its own `DEVBUILD_WORK_VOLUME` (the
ccache and Zig cache volumes are safe to share). `DEVBUILD_JOBS=N` caps the
build at N jobs and pins the container to N CPUs.

## Project Architecture

### Server Architecture

Three coordinated processes:

1. **loginserver** - Handles authentication and character selection
2. **sharedserver** - Manages shared data (e.g., guild info) across game servers
3. **gameserver** - The main game logic server (one per world/zone group)

CMake is the build system; the `Makefile`s in `src/` subdirectories are
legacy and superseded. No target globs its sources: every `.cpp` is named,
which is what lets ratchet R15 call a source no target compiles dead.

### Packet System

Packets are the primary communication mechanism between servers and clients.
Each is named for the link it rides, source letter first: **CG**/**GC**
between client and gameserver, **CL**/**LC** between client and loginserver,
**GL**/**LG** between game and login servers, **GS**/**SG** between game and
shared servers, **GG** between gameservers, and **GM** for the server-info
datagram a gameserver sends the loginserver.

Each packet lives in two layers:
- `src/Core/PacketName.{h,cpp}` — the packet class (wire layout only; no
  `execute()`), its `PacketNameFactory`, and the declaration of its handler.
- `src/server/<server>/handler/PacketNameHandler.cpp` — the handler body.
  There is no handler header: the class is declared beside the packet.

The handler is bound to its packet id at the server's composition root —
`GamePacketDispatch.cpp`, `LoginPacketDispatch.cpp`,
`SharedPacketDispatch.cpp` — with `DE_REGISTER_PACKET_HANDLER(Name)`. Each
root also declares the links it accepts as a `de::packet::DirectionSet`
(`kReceivedDirections`), so registering a handler for a packet on a link the
server does not receive is a compile error.

Every `XFactory` states its packet's id, name and maximum body size as
`static constexpr kPacketID` / `kName` / `kMaxSize`; the virtual getters
return them. `src/Core/PacketMeta.h` names that contract
(`de::PacketFactoryType`) and folds a pack of factories into a `constexpr`
table (`de::packet::FactoryList`) that rejects duplicate or out-of-range ids
while compiling. `PacketFactoryManager::init()` selects per server from four
such lists — edit the lists, not an `addFactory` sequence: the gameserver
`Concat`s three, the loginserver two, the sharedserver uses one as it is.
`tests/packet_meta_test.cpp` compiles the whole kernel into one list. A new
packet needs the three constants in its factory or it will not satisfy the
concept. See `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` §3 and `.claude/skills/add-packet`.

### Preprocessor Macros

Compile definitions that control behavior, set per target in the
CMakeLists.txt files — plus `LoginServer.h` and `SharedServer.h`, which
define their own server macro so that including the header makes the
translation unit that server's: `__GAME_SERVER__` /
`__LOGIN_SERVER__` / `__SHARED_SERVER__` say which server a translation unit
is compiled for, `__COMBAT__` enables combat code (the gameserver targets
define it), `__LINUX__` comes from the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`.

A macro no build defines makes the block behind it dead text, so R14 holds
the count of the ones that were removed at zero; do not reintroduce one.

### Configuration

`conf/` holds `gameserver.conf`, `loginserver.conf` and `sharedserver.conf`.
The settings that matter most: `HomePath` (the repository directory, which
must be set correctly), `DB_HOST` (database address) and `LoginServerIP`.
The `WorldDBInfo` and `GameServerInfo` database tables must agree with these
files.

## Database Setup

The project requires MySQL 5.7 or 8 with specific SQL mode settings:

```sql
-- Remove NO_ZERO_DATE and STRICT_TRANS_TABLES from sql_mode
set @@global.sql_mode = 'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION';
```

Text is UTF-8 end to end. Both databases and every table are InnoDB in
`utf8mb4` / `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` (`tests/ratchet/ratchets.sh` fails on any
other engine or charset in `initdb/`), the MySQL containers run
`--character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, and
every server pins its session to `utf8mb4` right after connecting
(`src/server/database/Connection.cpp`). The pin matters: the 8.0 client
library asks MySQL 5.7 for a collation it does not know, and the server then
silently drops the session to latin1 and passes text through as raw bytes.
The dumps' legacy EUC-KR and GBK text was re-encoded to real UTF-8 with
`tools/reencode_legacy_dump.pl`, which documents how each literal's language
was decided.

All SQL lives behind repository seams: an interface `*Repository.h` with a
`MySQL*Repository.cpp` implementation under a `repository/` directory,
reached through a `default*Repository()` accessor. The header is the
authority on its tables' quirks and, where SQL on the same tables lives
outside the seam, carries an explicit "not enclosed" list of it (nine
headers do today) — read it before adding a method. R2/R3 fail on
an `executeQuery` written anywhere else.

Databases:
- `DARKEDEN` - Main game database
- `USERINFO` - User account database

Account passwords live in `Player.Password` as argon2id hashes. A database
created before that change needs `initdb/migrations/001-argon2-password-column.sql`
run once; its plaintext rows are rehashed by the loginserver on each
account's next login. `bin/hashpw` hashes a password for a manual `UPDATE`.

Load schema with (`initdb/a-setup.sql` creates both databases and the
`elcastle` user; the docker compose setup applies all three automatically):
```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p < initdb/a-setup.sql
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u elcastle -D 'DARKEDEN' -p < initdb/DARKEDEN.sql
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u elcastle -D 'USERINFO' -p < initdb/USERINFO.sql
```

## Dependencies

Required libraries (all expose a C API — see `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` for why
re-introducing a C++-API dependency is a problem under the Zig toolchain):
- **libmysqlclient-dev** - MySQL client library (Ubuntu 20.04 ships 8.0 /
  `libmysqlclient21`; the server talks to MySQL 5.7 or 8)
- **lua5.1-dev** or **luajit** - Lua scripting (used by quest system)
- **zlib**

XML parsing uses the vendored **tinyxml2** (10.0.0) in `third_party/tinyxml2`,
wrapped by `SXml` in Core; xerces-c is no longer needed (`docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` §1).
Password hashing uses the vendored **argon2** reference implementation
(20190702, C API) in `third_party/argon2`; nothing to install for it.

Install on Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install libmysqlclient-dev liblua5.1-dev zlib1g-dev
```

## Key Game Concepts

- **Races** — **Slayer** (human vampire hunters), **Vampire**, **Ousters**,
  one `PlayerCreature` subclass each
- **Zone/ZoneGroup** - Geographic areas where players exist; **DynamicZone**
  is instanced content (e.g. dungeons)
- **Creature** - Base class for all entities (players, monsters, NPCs)
- **Effect** - Time-based effects applied to creatures
- **Skill** - Combat and utility abilities
- **Guild/Party** - Social grouping systems

## Thread ownership

The gameserver's threading contract, as the code actually implements it.

### Threads in the gameserver process

- **Main thread** — runs `GameServer::init()` (single-threaded startup:
  config, DB, zone loading), then `GameServer::start()`, which spawns the
  threads below and finally becomes `ClientManager::run()`, an infinite
  loop accepting client TCP connections and driving the pre-zone
  login/handshake phase before a player is handed to a zone group.
- **`ZoneGroupThread` (one per `ZoneGroup`,** via
  `ThreadManager`/`ThreadPool`) — the owner of all zone-group state. Its
  loop is: lock the group's mutex → `ZoneGroup::processPlayers()` (socket
  `select`, read, parse, `PacketDispatcher::dispatch` of **CG** packets)
  and `ZoneGroup::heartbeat()` (NPC/monster AI, effects, zone systems) →
  unlock. So all CG handler code runs on the zone thread **with the group
  mutex held**. Each zone thread registers its own DB `Connection` keyed
  by thread id (`DatabaseManager::addConnection(Thread::self(), …)`) — DB
  connections are thread-local by convention, never shared.
- **`LoginServerManager` thread** — UDP datagram link to the loginserver;
  dispatches **LG** and **GG** packets on its own thread under its own
  `m_Mutex`.
- **`SharedServerManager` thread** — TCP link to the sharedserver;
  dispatches **SG** packets on its own thread under its own `m_Mutex`.
- **`MPlayerManager` (mofus), `GDRLairManager`** — auxiliary threads with
  their own loops. (`SMSServiceThread` is a `ManagedThread` too, but
  `GameServer::start()` never starts it; its queue is only filled by
  `CGSMSSendHandler`. Neither billing integration is in the tree: the
  external billing link had a thread of its own, and the China one its own
  tree.)

The loginserver and sharedserver follow the same contract. The loginserver's
main thread runs `ClientManager::run()` and its `GameServerManager` worker
owns the UDP link to the game servers; the sharedserver's main thread runs
`HeartbeatManager::run()` and its `GameServerManager` worker owns the TCP
listener plus `GuildManager::heartbeat()`. Each worker registers its own DB
`Connection` keyed by `Thread::self()` where it needs one.

Every worker in all three processes uses `ManagedThread` (`std::jthread`);
it is the only remaining subclass of the legacy `Thread`. Start and
stop are serialized; stop-before-start is terminal, and join allows a
concurrent stop request. Derived destructors must stop/join before destroying
members. SIGTERM/SIGINT request process shutdown; main exits its client loop,
requests every worker to stop, and joins them while dependencies remain alive.
The process then uses `_Exit` to reclaim the legacy singleton graph without
running its unaudited destructors. This does not add a world-save operation.
A 30-second watchdog (`ServerShutdown::Deadline`) forces a nonzero exit if
startup, I/O or a heartbeat prevents shutdown. See `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` for
the full contract.

### The mutation rule

**Zone-group state (Zones, Creatures in them, the group's
`ZonePlayerManager`) may only be touched while that group's mutex is
held.** The group's own `ZoneGroupThread` holds it for its entire tick;
any other thread must take it explicitly, e.g.
`__ENTER_CRITICAL_SECTION((*(pZone->getZoneGroup())))` — `GDRLairManager`
does this at every site that touches zone-group state. Its
`addEffect_LOCKING`/`deleteEffect_LOCKING` calls need no group mutex: they
go to the zone's separate locked effect manager, which the tick services
only under `Zone::m_MutexEffect`, the one sub-lock designed for cross-thread
adds. Note `Zone::m_Mutex` is a **different, narrower** lock some
main-thread heartbeats take (war/ctf via `pZone->lock()`); holding it does
NOT exclude the zone-group tick and does not satisfy this rule.

`__ENTER_CRITICAL_SECTION` / `__LEAVE_CRITICAL_SECTION` delimit a **block**
owned by a scoped `CriticalSection` guard (`src/Core/Exception.h`), so the lock
is released on every exit — end of block, `return`, `goto`/`continue` out of it,
and any thrown type. Consequently a hand-written `x.unlock()` inside a section
is a **double unlock** of a non-recursive mutex: to run work unlocked, use
`__CRITICAL_SECTION_LOCK.unlock()` / `.lock()`, the guard's own name.
`tests/tools/critical_section_audit.pl` fails on a hand-written one; it runs
in ctest as `critical_section_audit`, alongside `ratchets` and `arch_includes`.

This is mutex-guarded ownership, not pure thread-affinity: the guarded
region is the contract. Under `DE_OWNERSHIP_CHECKS` — defined only for
Debug builds; this project deliberately never defines `NDEBUG`, so the
checks ride their own macro and every optimized build compiles them away
completely — `ZoneGroup::lock()` records the holding thread
(`pthread_equal` + a valid flag, never a raw `==` or zero-tid sentinel)
and `ZoneGroup::assertOwned()` **calls `abort()`** on a violation. It
must not throw: an `AssertionError` is a `Throwable`, and the
`catch (Throwable&)` blocks sitting on these very paths would swallow it,
turning a detected race into a silently half-applied mutation. The check
is armed by `ZoneGroupThread::run()`, so single-threaded startup/loading
is exempt. `ZoneGroup::drainMailbox` asserts too; on `Zone` the coverage
is exactly the eight gateways — `addPC` (both
overloads), `replacePC`, `addCreature`, `deleteCreature`, `moveCreature`,
and the tile-only pair `addCreatureToTile`/`deleteCreatureFromTile` that
the move-mode swaps and corpse paths use — so every creature write to a
`Tile` outside `ZoneSpawn.cpp` and `ZoneMove.cpp`, where the gateways live,
is gated. `Zone::movePC`/`deletePC`/`pushPC`/`addItem`/`deleteItem` are
**not**: the assert is a tripwire on the main gateways, not a guarantee.

### Cross-thread communication

- Cross-thread packet handlers (SG/LG/GG, on the manager threads) reach
  player creatures through the player-creature finder
  (`de::gameContext().playerCreatures()`) under **its** critical section
  (`getCreature_LOCKED`), then use `pPlayer->sendPacket(...)` — sending
  to a player's socket is the main legitimate cross-thread operation.
- Anything beyond sending — gold, guild id, kick flags, a zone broadcast —
  goes through the player's **mailbox** (`src/server/Mailbox.h`, owned by
  `GamePlayer`): `de::postToPlayer(name, command[, ifGone[, scope]])`
  (`src/server/gameserver/PlayerMailbox.h`) finds the player under the
  PCFinder lock and queues the command; the manager that owns the player
  drains it from the one place it processes its players, each tick, before
  the player's own packets. The box belongs to the player rather than to a
  group because a player's owner changes over its life (the main thread's
  `IncomingPlayerManager` during login and zone transfer, a
  `ZonePlayerManager` on a zone thread in between) and the creature's zone
  pointer does not say which — it is set as soon as the character loads and
  stays on the old zone during a transfer, so the box follows the player and
  keeps posting order across group changes. The zone manager, under the group
  mutex, runs everything (for a player whose creature is in another group's
  zone — the listing mismatch it already logs as ZPMCheck — only the
  player-scoped ones); the main thread runs only `Scope::Player` commands
  (the kick flags), because the zone the creature points at is ticking
  elsewhere, so `Scope::Zone` commands wait in order for a zone thread. A
  player who logs out with commands pending runs their `ifGone` handlers
  instead (`~GamePlayer`, right after the PCFinder removal, so exactly one
  of command/`ifGone` runs), for the handlers whose offline branch matters,
  like charging a guild fee in the database. Commands capture by value only
  (a `Guild*`/`GuildMember*` may be deleted before they run) and run without
  the PCFinder lock, so they may post to other players. `ZoneGroup` has a box
  of its own (`ZoneGroup::post()`, drained at the top of the tick under the
  group mutex) for group-level work from other threads; its producer is
  dynamic zone recycling, handing an instance's `init()` to its owner.
- Tables that every thread reads and one thread occasionally extends — a
  group's zone map, the `ZoneInfoManager` lookups — are published
  copy-on-write through `de::Snapshot` (`src/server/Snapshot.h`): readers
  load an immutable `shared_ptr<const T>` without waiting on a writer and
  may iterate it for a whole tick; a writer copies, changes and swaps the
  pointer under a leaf mutex held for nothing else. That is what lets a
  zone thread create a dynamic zone in another group's map while that
  group iterates it. The writer mutex is held while the change runs, so a
  change must be pure work on the copy (the current ones are map inserts
  and erases); the snapshot protects the table, not the objects it points
  to, which stay raw pointers with their old lifetime rules.
- Players enter a zone group through the `ZonePlayerManager` under its
  lock; the zone thread integrates them on its next tick.

### Known violations (all closed; the rules they left behind)

- **SG/LG/GG handlers must not mutate creature state under the `PCFinder`
  lock alone.** The six guild handlers and `LGKickCharacter` post their
  gold / guild-id / kick-flag / zone-broadcast work through
  `de::postToPlayer`. `GuildManager` and `Guild` lock their maps on both
  sides: `getMembers_NOLOCKED()` is the writer thread's, readers copy the
  member names under the guild mutex, and deleting a guild empties its map
  through `retireAllMembers()`. The per-member flags and counters and the
  guild's own integral fields are atomics, the rank change and its counter
  update going under the mutex together; its strings are copied in and out
  under `Guild::m_Mutex`, a non-recursive leaf the string accessors take and
  nothing else, so code already holding it touches the members directly. Lifetime is handled by not freeing: `getGuild()` and
  `getMember()` return raw pointers after releasing their locks, so a
  deleted guild or member is *retired* (`GuildManager::m_RetiredGuilds`,
  `Guild::m_RetiredMembers`; the whole-table `clear()` a sharedserver resync
  triggers retires too, never frees) and stays readable, stale, until the managers
  are destroyed. **Still open:** a zone thread reading a retired member sees
  its last rank.
- **No creature is written to a `Tile` outside `ZoneSpawn.cpp` and
  `ZoneMove.cpp`.** PC swaps go through `Zone::replacePC`; the move-mode
  swaps, the knockback and NPC-warp moves, and the corpse paths that take a
  dead creature off the map while its manager keeps it go through
  `Zone::addCreatureToTile` / `Zone::deleteCreatureFromTile`, all gated.
- **A zone map may be extended from another group's thread**, because the
  group's zone map and the `ZoneInfoManager` tables are `de::Snapshot`s: the
  iterating heartbeat and every concurrent `getZone()` keep the map they
  loaded. A recycled instance's `init()` is posted to the owning group
  (`ZoneGroup::post()`), `DynamicZoneGroup` serialises selection/creation
  under its own mutex, and the instance status flag is atomic. `addZone` is
  not a gateway, so the assert does not see this path.
- **`GDRLairManager` takes the owning group's mutex at every site** that
  walks its PCManager, sweeps effects or writes inventory and registries.
  None of those sites hits a gated gateway.
- **Packets pipelined behind `CGReady` are drained by the zone thread.**
  `GamePlayer::processCommand` stops the main-thread
  (`IncomingPlayerManager`) drain once the status flips to `GPS_NORMAL`, so
  nothing reaches a gateway without the group mutex.

## Running the Servers

Start servers in this order:
```bash
./bin/loginserver -f ./conf/loginserver.conf
./bin/sharedserver -f ./conf/sharedserver.conf
./bin/gameserver -f ./conf/gameserver.conf
```

In the container image `docker/start.sh` does this (it uses `docker/conf/`
rather than `conf/`).

## Development Notes

- Source file encoding is **UTF-8** (the project was migrated from legacy
  encodings). R17 counts the source lines that still carry a non-ASCII byte;
  all of them are string literals now, and it only goes down.
- Write comments in **English**, and describe behaviour: no task numbers,
  dates, review history or migration narrative in `src/` or `tests/`.
  Translate the legacy Korean or mojibake comments you come across.
- C++20 is the required language standard, verified with the pinned
  Zig/Clang container toolchain.
- Exceptions: `throw Error("text")`, never `throw "text"` — a bare literal
  throws a `const char*`, a type nothing in the tree catches, so it walks
  past every handler into a `catch (...)` backstop or `std::terminate`
  (R11/R10b hold both at zero). Gameplay results use
  `Outcome<Events, Rejection>` (`src/Core/Outcome.h`); exceptions are for
  programming and configuration errors.
- Deep inheritance is the house style (Creature → PlayerCreature →
  Slayer/Vampire/Ousters), and Lua drives the quest system
  (`quest/luaScript/`).
