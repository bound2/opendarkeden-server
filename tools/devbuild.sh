# devbuild.sh — fast containerised build and test for local development.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The obvious way to build in a container on Windows is to bind-mount the
# checkout and run cmake against it. That is what we did, and a full build
# took ~20 minutes at ~20% CPU on an 8-core machine. The compiler was not the
# bottleneck; the mount was. Measured inside the container, against the
# checkout on the Windows filesystem versus the container's own:
#
#     stat 2000 headers      0.813s   vs  0.005s   (160x)
#     read 500 headers       1.173s   vs  0.008s   (145x)
#
# Every translation unit opens dozens of headers, and every incremental build
# re-stats the whole dependency graph, so the build spends its life waiting on
# 9p round-trips instead of compiling.
#
# The build inputs are small — src/ and tests/ are ~37 MB across ~4,500 files,
# while build/, lib/ and bin/ are ~5.6 GB of artifacts. So this script copies
# the *inputs* into a container-local volume once (incrementally thereafter)
# and keeps every artifact off the mount entirely.
#
# It also switches the dev build to the same toolchain the production
# Dockerfile already uses and explains there: Ninja rather than Unix
# Makefiles, because with Makefiles a target's objects are not compiled until
# every library it links against has finished *linking*, which idles cores at
# each Core -> Packets -> server boundary; plus ccache, so a rebuild after a
# branch switch reuses objects instead of recompiling them.
#
# USAGE (from the repository root)
#
#     tools/devbuild.sh test              # build wire_tests + run ctest
#     tools/devbuild.sh test --record     # same, but re-record goldens first
#     tools/devbuild.sh build             # build every production target
#     tools/devbuild.sh build wire_tests  # build one target
#     tools/devbuild.sh output-dir        # print this lane's artifact root
#     tools/devbuild.sh shell             # interactive shell in the workspace
#     tools/devbuild.sh clean             # drop the workspace and compiler
#                                         # caches unless only the workspace
#                                         # volume was overridden — see below
#
# Parallel checkouts (git worktrees): set DEVBUILD_WORK_VOLUME to give each
# checkout its own workspace volume — two concurrent builds sharing one
# volume race this script's rsync --delete. DEVBUILD_CCACHE_VOLUME and
# DEVBUILD_ZIG_CACHE_VOLUME may stay shared (both caches are concurrency-safe).
# `clean` under a DEVBUILD_WORK_VOLUME override removes only that workspace,
# never the shared default compiler caches.
#
# Generated test data (goldens, the wire-layout inventory, the generated
# factory list) is copied back into the checkout after a run, so a --record
# leaves a reviewable diff exactly as an in-tree build would.
