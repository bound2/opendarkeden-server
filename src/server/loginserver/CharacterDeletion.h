// retireSlayer, a compare-and-set whose result is itself the last of the
// refusals: it retires the Slayer row that indexes the character, and the
// caller purges the rest only once it has.
//
// A repository that fails its query throws (the DB layer's own const
// char*); that is a server fault, not a player-facing rejection, and is
// left to the caller.
