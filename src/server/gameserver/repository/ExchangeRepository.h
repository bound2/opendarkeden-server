// The Exchange feature's tables: the listings and the orders placed on
// them (ExchangeListing, ExchangeOrder) and the account point ledger
// (AccountPoint, PointLedger), plus the transaction pair the buy path
// wraps around a purchase.
//
// One connection. Every statement runs on the thread's game connection
// (DatabaseManager::getConnection, the DB_* block). The listings and orders
// live in that connection's own schema; AccountPoint and PointLedger live
// in the account database (initdb/USERINFO.sql), and the point statements
// name them by that schema -- `<schema>`.AccountPoint -- instead of asking
// for a connection of their own. The account connection
// (getUserInfoConnection()) is one per process, shared by every thread
// without a lock, so a zone thread's purchase cannot run on it; by schema
// name the ledger runs on the thread's own connection, and a purchase is
// one transaction on one connection whose commit is atomic.
//
// The point ledger opens at startup. openExchangePointLedger (below) names
// the account schema -- the gameserver passes the configuration's UI_DB_DB --
// and checks, on the calling thread's game connection, that the game and
// account connections reach one MySQL server (their @@server_uuid) and that
// every statement shape the ledger issues runs there against no row: the
// tables, their columns and DB_USER's privileges on them. Until a check
// passes the ledger is closed: pointLedgerOpen() answers false,
// decideBuyListing refuses every buy as a database error before any point
// statement, and a point statement called anyway throws a DatabaseError.
// The rest of the Exchange (listing, browsing, claims) does not need the
// ledger and keeps working. So a deployment whose UI_DB_* block names
// another server, a schema DB_USER may not write, or no schema at all runs
// without Exchange purchases, and the gameserver says so at startup
// (ExchangeService::openPointLedger) rather than at the first buy.
//
// The transaction pair. A purchase (completeExchangePurchase in
// exchange/ExchangePurchase.h) runs its writes between beginTransaction and
// commit under an ExchangeTransaction guard, which calls rollback on every
// other way out, a thrown DatabaseError included. The three are START
// TRANSACTION, COMMIT and ROLLBACK on the game connection, so the claim,
// the order and both ledger rows commit together or not at all.
//  - The writes run in one order: the claim (markListingSold, whose UPDATE
//    takes the listing's row lock and matches only an ACTIVE row), the
//    order, then the buyer's debit and the seller's credit. A failure at
//    any of them, refused or thrown, rolls all of them back.
//  - Every purchase takes its listing lock before its ledger locks, so two
//    purchases wait on each other in one order; a cycle they still form is
//    InnoDB's to detect, and its deadlock error is a thrown failure like
//    any other.
//  - A ROLLBACK with nothing begun, or after its COMMIT went through, is a
//    no-op.
//
// Collisions. Two buyers of one listing -- two zone threads of one server,
// or two servers of one world -- meet at the claim: the second UPDATE waits
// for the first purchase's row lock, then matches no ACTIVE row and is
// refused as no longer available, before either reaches ExchangeOrder's
// UNIQUE ListingID or the ledger's UNIQUE IdempotencyKey. A ledger key can
// still collide when two listings' purchases carry one client key: the
// count inside adjustPoints sees a committed one and answers false, and an
// uncommitted one makes the INSERT wait and then fail with ER_DUP_ENTRY.
// Either way the purchase rolls back, finds the key in the ledger and
// refuses as a replay.
//
// Text arguments (accounts, players, item names, idempotency keys) are
// escaped with mysql_real_escape_string on the game connection, or by
// a manual quote/backslash pass when no connection is up; the datetime
// text expireAt is interpolated raw. CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, SoldAt,
// CancelledAt and DeliveredAt are the server process's local time,
// formatted here; a caller's createdAt/updatedAt/deliveredAt fields are
// ignored on insert.
//
// ExchangeListing's UNIQUE KEY (ItemClass, ItemID, ObjectID), and the
// fact that no statement deletes a listing row, mean createListing for an
// object that was ever listed -- whatever status its old row is in now --
// fails with ER_DUP_ENTRY (thrown as a DatabaseError). ExchangeOrder's
// UNIQUE ListingID does the same to a second order on one listing.
//
// The methods keep the __BEGIN_TRY / __END_CATCH frames and the bool
// results the Exchange service was written against: a false from the
// other listing and order writes and from the transaction pair is
// unreachable (the SQL failure throws first); only markListingSold and
// adjustPoints answer false on their own.
//

// client mirrors); ExchangeOrder and the status and reason codes are
