// The wars running on this server. A castle zone's scheduler hands each
// castle war over when it starts (addWarDelayed); the race war is scheduled
// here. The main thread's heartbeat ends a war when its time runs out, or
// once endWar has moved its end to now, and frees it.
//
// Locks, and the order they are taken in:
//
// - m_Mutex guards the schedules -- the running wars -- and the race war's
//   schedule. The heartbeat holds it while it starts and ends wars, and
//   under it takes: zones' own mutexes (Zone::lock, returning castle symbols
//   and blood bibles, restoring shrine shields, keeping the holy land's
//   players), the holy land and shrine managers' mutexes, the player finder's
//   lock, every group's ZonePlayerManager mutex (broadcasts), the client
//   manager's event mutex, the guild manager's mutex (guild names), and the
//   three mutexes below. It takes no zone group's mutex and no castle
//   scheduler's: a castle's owner change, which reloads the scheduler, is
//   posted to the castle's group (CastleInfoManager::postCastleWarEnd).
// - So a thread may take m_Mutex holding its zone group's mutex -- a CG
//   handler or a quest action answering a player: endWar, isModifyCastleOwner,
//   getSiegeGuildSide, mayModifyShrineOwner, addRaceWarScheduleInfo.
// - Never holding a castle scheduler's mutex (WarScheduler::m_Mutex), which
//   Zone::heartbeat takes under the zone's own: that would close the cycle
//   below. A scheduler takes nothing of the war system's or of any zone under
//   its mutex -- makeGCWarScheduleList asks for the race war's line after
//   releasing it, and a castle war whose time has come is taken out of the
//   queue under it and started after -- only the database and the guild
//   manager's and a guild's mutexes (guild names), and neither of those is
//   held while a scheduler's mutex is taken: a guild's deletion posts its
//   schedule cancel to the castle's group.
// - Nothing may take m_Mutex holding a zone's own mutex, which Zone::heartbeat
//   holds over NPC, monster and effect processing: the heartbeat, holding
//   m_Mutex, waits for that zone's mutex, and the zone thread waits for
//   m_Mutex. That deadlock is why hasCastleActiveWar answers from its own
//   list. Code there asks the lock-free race war hints or the running-war
//   list below.
// - m_MutexActiveWars (the running castle wars' zones and attackers) and
//   m_MutexWarQueue (wars handed over, not yet added) are leaves: nothing is
//   taken under them, so they may be taken anywhere, a zone's heartbeat
//   included. m_MutexWarList guards the cached war list, and a player's send
//   and the guild manager's mutex are taken under it.
//
// No war is handed out past m_Mutex: every question about a running war is
// answered inside the lock, because the heartbeat frees the war under it.
