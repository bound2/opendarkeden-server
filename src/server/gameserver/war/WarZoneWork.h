// Description : a war's zone work, posted to the threads that own it.
//
//               A war starts and ends on the thread that runs its schedule
//               -- the main thread's war heartbeat, a castle zone's own
//               scheduler, or a zone thread whose GM starts the race war --
//               and the zones it changes belong to their zone groups'
//               threads (CLAUDE.md, "Thread ownership"). Each change is
//               therefore posted to the owning group (ZoneGroup::post) or,
//               for an item a player carries, to the player
//               (de::postToPlayer), capturing only values: zone ids, item
//               ids and the item-object row that says where an item lies.
//               The command looks the zone up again when it runs, on the
//               owner's thread under the group mutex. The routing decisions
//               are in WarZoneRouting.h.

// the zone's group for an item on the ground or in a corpse, the player for
// an item in an inventory or on the mouse. The holder's step takes the item
// out under the holder's lock only if it is still that item, and hands it to
// taken. A step that finds the item gone reads the row again and follows it
// (WarZoneRouting.h, kItemReturnAttempts); a player who logs out first drops
// what he carried (a dragon eye goes back to its default tile instead), and
// the zone's add saves the row as it does for any relic, so the return
// follows it from there. A row naming a player who is no longer logged in
// is read again the same way: he dropped the item before he was gone.
// False when no step could be posted: no row, a holder no position loader
// reaches, or a row that still names a player who is not logged in after
// the last attempt (each logged to WarError.log). No relic can lie where no
// position reaches (relicMayLieIn), and a relic's row names a zone of this
// server: the war relics are made in this server's shrines and default
// tiles, a player carries them only between this server's zones, and he
// drops them before his logout hands him to another server.
