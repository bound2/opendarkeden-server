// Filename    : PlayerMailbox.h
// Description : Run a command against a logged-in player on the thread
//               that owns the player, under that owner's lock.
//
//               This is how the cross-thread packet handlers (SG/LG/GG, on
//               the SharedServerManager / LoginServerManager threads) reach
//               a PlayerCreature without racing its owner. Before, they
//               mutated gold, guild id and kick flags holding only the
//               PCFinder lock, which serialises lookup and removal but not
//               the zone tick -- the "SG/LG/GG handlers" entry in CLAUDE.md's
//               known violations. Sending a packet to the player's socket is
//               still fine from any thread and does not need this.
//
//               The box belongs to the GamePlayer, not to a zone group, and
//               that is the point: a player's owner changes over its life --
//               the main thread's IncomingPlayerManager during login and
//               zone transfer, a ZonePlayerManager on a zone thread while
//               in a zone group -- and the creature's own zone pointer does
//               not say which: it is set as soon as the character loads,
//               before any zone thread owns it, and stays on the old zone
//               during a transfer. So the box moves with the player and
//               keeps its commands in posting order across group changes.
//               Each owner drains it from the one place it processes the
//               players it owns, under its own lock:
//
//                 * ZonePlayerManager::processCommands, on the zone thread
//                   under the group mutex, runs everything -- the creature
//                   is in one of that group's zones, so zone state is safe;
//                 * IncomingPlayerManager::processCommands, on the main
//                   thread, runs only Scope::Player commands (kick flags),
//                   because while it owns the player the zone the creature
//                   points at is ticking on another thread. Scope::Zone
//                   commands wait, in order, until a zone thread owns the
//                   player again; a Scope::Player command may overtake them.
//
//               A player that logs out with commands pending runs their
//               ifGone handlers instead, from ~GamePlayer right after the
//               PCFinder removal that makes it "gone".

//
//  * The command runs later, on the owner's next pass over the player, and
//    only if the player is still logged in then. A player that logged out
//    in between is skipped, exactly as the old code skipped a player it
//    could not find -- unless `ifGone` is given, which then runs in its
//    place (on the thread that destroys the player), for the handlers whose
//    offline branch does something material, like charging a fee in the
//    database instead of in memory. Exactly one of the two ever runs: the
//    post and the PCFinder removal both take the PCFinder lock, and the
//    abandon follows the removal.
//  * Everything the command needs must be captured by value. A Guild* or
//    GuildMember* captured by pointer may be deleted before the command
//    runs (SGDeleteGuildOK deletes both); capture ids and names and look
//    the objects up again inside.
//
// The command runs without the PCFinder lock (its owner's lock is what
// protects it), so it may call postToPlayer itself, e.g. for another
// player. A command that throws -- any type -- is logged and dropped; the
// rest of the batch still runs.

// another thread is ticking. abandonPlayerMailbox runs the ifGone handlers
// of everything pending and drops the commands; called at logout.
