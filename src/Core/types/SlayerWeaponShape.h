// The five weapon bits of a slayer's outlook name one of the client's
// weapon templates (Client/PacketFunction.cpp, g_pPacketItemWeapon), and
// the client draws the other player with that template's addon frames and
// attacks with its action. The retail client split the families into
// variants for the high-tier models, whose frames differ from the base
// model's, and it picks each variant by the item type of the real item.
// The server sends the same variant for the same item, so what a player
// sees on others is what those players see on themselves.
//
// The thresholds come from the client's Item.inf: the addon frames of a
// sword or blade change at type 16, those of a rifle at types 14, 15 and
// 16, those of a cross or mace at type 14; shotguns and submachine guns
// keep one frame set for the whole class.
