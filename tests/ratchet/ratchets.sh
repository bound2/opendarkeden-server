# would also match the CR of a CRLF working tree and count every ASCII
# message whose literal runs past the end of its line. LC_ALL=C keeps the
# range byte-wise, and the bracket form keeps this portable where grep -P

# --- R13: duplicated include guards ----------------------------------------
# Two headers sharing a guard name means whichever one a translation unit

# renamed to make the names unique tree-wide, including per-server twins
# (loginserver/sharedserver copies of GameServerInfo.h and friends) that
# cannot meet in one binary today -- uniqueness across the whole tree is the
# invariant worth holding, because which headers share a binary changes.
#
# Measured on each header's FIRST #ifndef, which is its guard, rather than on
# every `^#ifndef` line: the tree also tests ordinary macros that way
# (Core/Types.h tests __XMAS_EVENT_CODE__ before defining it), so a
# line-based count could never reach zero. The awk resets `seen` at FNR==1 so `find -exec ... +`
# batching stays per-file, and strips the CR of the CRLF working tree before
# comparing. The list is materialised first so an empty one (a broken find,
# a moved src/) fails loudly instead of passing as zero duplicates.

# --- R14: mentions of macros nothing defines -------------------------------
# A macro no build defines -- not cmake/, a CMakeLists.txt, a Makefile, a

# reached the compiler, so the #else/#ifndef branch beside it was the only
# code the servers ran, while the block kept reading as live code and
# drifting out of sync with the headers it names. A translation-unit-local
# #define arms one again, and one did: it gave that TU a
# SystemAvailabilitiesManager with an extra member and a layout no other TU
# shared.
#
# The region builds went first. __THAILAND_SERVER__ and __CHINA_SERVER__
# selected a Thailand or a China build; counted with them are the
# misspellings __CHAINA_SERVER__ and __THIALAND_SERVER__, which appeared
# inside the same conditions, and __INTERNATIONAL_SERVER__, a dead #elif in
# the same Encrypter.h chain. __NETMARBLE_SERVER__ was a portal build (a
# terms-of-use byte on the end of LCPCList, DELETE instead of INACTIVE in the
# character purge) and __TEST_SERVER__ a test build (fame*10 in the Blood
# Bible ladders, an auth timer on connect, a level-150 class-exp gift).
# Three of the __NETMARBLE_SERVER__ blocks called
# LoginPlayer::setAgree/isAgree, which no header declares, so they could not
# have compiled had it been defined.
#
# The feature macros followed: __OLD_GUILD_WAR__ (guild union and tax
# handlers that only answered "not supported yet", and a one-attacker war
# schedule where the live read takes five), __CONNECT_BILLING_SYSTEM__ and
# __COUT_BILLING_SYSTEM__ (the external billing link and its console trace),
# __PAY_SYSTEM_ZONE__ / __PAY_SYSTEM_LOGIN__ / __PAY_SYSTEM_FREE_LIMIT__
# (the paid-zone, paid-login and free-play-limit gates -- with none of them
# defined GamePlayer::isPayPlaying() answers true for every player and each
# gate passes), __UNDERWORLD__ (an underworld monster flag, its protection
# rule and its prize), __ACTIVE_QUEST__ (an NPC quest board),
# __ACTIVE_SERVICE_DEADLINE__ (a date past which the session's encrypt code
# was to be corrupted) and __WINDOWS__ (the Windows arm of the platform
# switch; __LINUX__ comes from the top-level CMakeLists.txt and __APPLE__
# from the compiler, so that arm was the only dead one).
#
# Deliberately not counted: the instrumentation toggles a developer switches
# on by hand (__PROFILE_*, __FULL_PROFILE__, __DEBUG_OUTPUT__,
# __OUTPUT_INIT__). Comments count -- a comment describing one of these
# branches describes code that is not there, so it states what the code does

# --- R16: headers under src/ that nothing includes -------------------------
# A header no translation unit reaches is not part of any build: nothing it
# declares is checked against the code it describes, so it drifts while
# still reading as live declarations and the compiler never says so. Five
# went at once, among them an ItemNumberManager.h whose body is not valid
# C++ and a CombatSystemManager.h for a relic system the servers run
# elsewhere. Three more headers were reached only by includes that used
# nothing from them, for classes declared here and defined nowhere; the
# includes went with the headers.
#
# The measure is an approximation, stated rather than hidden: a header
# counts as included when some #include "..." text under src/ or tests/
# equals the header's path or the path ends with "/" plus that text. That
# is looser than resolving each include against the including file's own
# directory and the -I list the CMake files build, so "Item.h" marks every
# path ending in /Item.h as reached. Every error it makes is in the same
# direction -- calling a header used -- so it never calls a live header
# dead. Comments are not stripped for the same reason: an include behind
# /* */ still counts as a mention.

# --- R17: source lines carrying non-ASCII bytes ----------------------------
# The tree's code language is English, so each of these is a line a reader
# cannot read. The legacy text came through the encoding migration in three
# states: readable Korean; mojibake, where EUC-KR/CP949 bytes were decoded
# as Latin-1 and re-encoded as UTF-8, which reads as runs of accented Latin
# letters; and U+FFFD runs, where the text itself is gone and only the code
# beside it still says what the comment meant. Comments are translated tree
# by tree: src/domain, src/server/database, src/server/loginserver,
# src/server/sharedserver, the whole of src/Core, the files directly under
# src/server, the gameserver's handler, war, gm, repository, mission,
# couple, ctf, packetfill and mofus trees, and the files directly under
# src/server/gameserver are done; what is left is the gameserver's skill,
# quest and item trees. String literals -- log lines, GM messages, the
# reserved-name table -- are left for a pass of their own, because changing
# one changes what the server says rather than how the source reads; the 493
# that remain in the finished trees, 482 of them in those gameserver trees,
# are all this count holds there.
#
# Line-based, and the byte class is spelled the way R12 spells it: exclude
# everything from \x01 to \x7f, so what is left is a byte with the high bit
# set -- a UTF-8 lead or continuation byte. That keeps the CR of a CRLF
# working tree out of the count, which [^[:print:]] would not, and LC_ALL=C
# keeps the range byte-wise where a locale would read it as characters.

# --- R18: commented-out code inside /* */ blocks ---------------------------
# Code that was switched off years ago says nothing true about the running
# server: it names globals that were deleted, calls signatures that changed
# and describes branches the build no longer has. It also reads as if it
# were a description of the code beside it, which is the expensive part.
# Comments that explain behaviour stay; this counts the ones that are code.
#
# The measure is deliberately narrow, because a narrow measure can be
# trusted. Only lines inside a *multi-line* /* */ comment count, and only
# those that look like a statement: a line ending in ";", "{" or "}", a
# preprocessor directive, a line opening with a control keyword or a type
# name, or an identifier followed by "(". The same test over "//" lines was
# measured and rejected: on a sample of 50 it called 13 prose lines code --
# section banners ("// class Foo member methods"), end-of-block markers
# ("// for"), and ordinary sentences that happen to open with "delete" or
# to mention a function by name. One in four is too loose to ratchet on, so
# "//" commented-out code is removed by hand without being counted here.
#
# The scanner walks each file character by character rather than matching
# line by line, so a "/*" inside a string literal or behind a "//" does not
# open a block. The first and last lines of a block carry the delimiters
# and are left out by the same test that skips a bare "/*" or "*/".
