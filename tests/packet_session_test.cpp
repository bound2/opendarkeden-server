// Description : Golden byte fixtures, loopback round trips and size
//               pins for the last two client/game-server families
//               without one: taking goods out of a quest stash and
//               wearing them, and the session traffic a client and a
//               game server exchange around a connection - asking for
//               another player's address, asking for a value, logging
//               out, the authentication key, the handover to another
//               server, the port check, the crash report, the lottery
//               pick, the pet gamble and the typed string list.
//
//               The set is taken from the code that sends them: the
//               handlers under src/server/gameserver/handler
//               (CGTakeOutGoodHandler, CGRequestIPHandler,
//               CGRequestInfoHandler, CGLogoutHandler,
//               CGAuthKeyHandler, CGPortCheckHandler,
//               CGCrashReportHandler, CGLotterySelectHandler,
//               CGPetGambleHandler, CGTypeStringListHandler) and the
//               senders outside handler/: quest/ActionTakeOutGoods.cpp,
//               quest/ActionGiveLotto.cpp, Slayer.cpp, Vampire.cpp,
//               Ousters.cpp and EventAuth.cpp. Eighteen packets, each
//               with the reason it is here:
//
//               CGTakeOutGood    the client asks for one of the goods
//                                a quest left in the stash, and
//               GCTakeOutOK      it is told the item came out,
//               GCTakeOutFail    or that it did not.
//               GCGoodsList      the listing of what is waiting, one
//                                record per item, with the options and
//                                the time limit each carries.
//               GCTakeOff        a wear slot is emptied, as the zone
//                                sees it.
//               GCRealWearingInfo    the bitset of the slots the
//                                character is really wearing, which
//                                the three races recompute whenever
//                                gear changes.
//
//               CGRequestIP      the client asks where another player
//                                is connected from, and
//               GCRequestedIP    the answer: the name, the address and
//                                the port.
//               CGRequestInfo    a code and a value, the general
//                                request for a piece of character
//                                information.
//               CGLogout         the client says it is leaving; the
//                                packet has no body at all.
//               CGAuthKey        the client returns the authentication
//                                key, and
//               GCAuthKey        the server hands one out.
//               GCReconnect      the handover: drop this connection
//                                and open one to the address in the
//                                packet, with this key.
//               CGPortCheck      the login server tells a game server
//                                which character is about to connect;
//                                a datagram, so it carries the sender
//                                address in its own header and only
//                                the character name in its body.
//               CGCrashReport    what the client sends after a crash:
//                                a fixed-width build time and fault
//                                address, a version word, and three
//                                WORD-counted strings.
//               CGLotterySelect  the pick, the scratch and the end of
//                                the lottery event.
//               CGPetGamble      the pet gamble request; no body.
//               CGTypeStringList a typed list of strings with one
//                                parameter, which the couple handlers
//                                use to ask for a meeting or a parting.
//
//               Deliberately excluded:
//
//               No packet in this family reads or writes the
//               encrypter. The nineteen src/Core sources that call
//               readEncrypt or writeEncrypt are CGAddMouseToZone,
//               CGAddZoneToInventory, CGAddZoneToMouse, CGAttack,
//               CGDissectionCorpse, CGDropMoney, CGMove,
//               CGNPCAskAnswer, CGPickupMoney, CGSkillToInventory,
//               CGSkillToObject, CGSkillToSelf, CGSkillToTile,
//               CGUseItemFromGear, CGUseItemFromInventory,
//               CGUsePotionFromInventory, GCAddItemToZone,
//               GCMoveError and GCMoveOK, all pinned at encrypt codes
//               0..5 by tests/packet_encrypter_test.cpp. None of the
//               eighteen derives from one of them: seventeen extend
//               Packet directly and CGPortCheck extends
//               DatagramPacket, which calls neither. So each stream
//               golden is recorded at code 0 and its test also asserts
//               the bytes do not vary with the code - adopting the
//               encrypter fails loudly instead of silently voiding the
//               pin.
//
//               Every one of the eighteen has a gameserver row in
//               tests/ratchet/factory_registrations.txt, and none had
//               a golden before this file. CGTypeStringList had an
//               entry-count pin in tests/packet_inventory_test.cpp and
//               CGCrashReport a string-cap pin in
//               tests/packet_roundtrip_test.cpp; both are single-aspect
//               and neither had a golden, so both packets are pinned in
//               full here.
//
//               With this file every registered GC/CG factory has a
//               golden: the names in factory_registrations.txt minus
//               the names under tests/golden/ is empty.
//
//               GCReconnect and GCAuthKey have no live sender -
//               nothing outside src/Core constructs a GCReconnect, and
//               the one GCAuthKey site in EventAuth.cpp is commented
//               out. Both are pinned anyway, because their factories
//               ARE registered: a registered factory is the wire
//               contract the client's own copy has to match, and a GC
//               packet the client can only receive needs no server
//               sender to be part of it.
//
//               Each packet gets three pins (SESSION_PACKET_TESTS):
//
//               - a loopback round trip through the real socket and
//                 stream classes, comparing every getter;
//               - the body bytes against tests/golden/<Name>.code0.hex;
//               - getPacketSize() against the byte count write()
//                 actually emits, and against the factory's
//                 getPacketMaxSize(). writePacket() puts
//                 getPacketSize() on the wire BEFORE calling write(),
//                 so a disagreement is not a wrong length, it is a
//                 stream that never resynchronises; and the receiving
//                 side sizes its read buffer from the factory max, so a
//                 body that outgrows it is a truncated packet, not a
//                 caught error.
//
//               CGPortCheck gets the datagram twin of those three
//               (SESSION_DATAGRAM_TESTS): its read() and write() take
//               a Datagram and DatagramPacket refuses a TCP stream by
//               design, so it is pinned through a real Datagram whose
//               header carries a MEASURED body length. That makes the
//               size pin three-way - the size field, the datagram's
//               length and getPacketSize() must name the same count -
//               and there is no encrypt code on that path at all,
//               which is why its golden carries no per-code assertion.
//
//               GCReconnect gets all three written out rather than
//               from the macro: it declares one byte more than it
//               writes - the first finding below - so its size pin
//               states the gap and its round trip pumps the measured
//               body instead of the declared one.
//
//               Extra goldens cover the branches one fixture cannot:
//               the goods listing with nothing in it (.empty) and with
//               the twenty records MAX_GOODS_LIST budgets (.full); the
//               address request with no name (.noname), the branch
//               write() takes when the count byte is zero; the string
//               list with no strings (.empty) and with the twenty of
//               full width its factory max budgets (.full); and the
//               crash report whose three optional strings are all
//               empty (.nostrings), which write() emits as three bare
//               zero-length words and read() refuses.
//
//               Fixture values are distinct per field and >= 128 in
//               every byte the width allows. Four groups cannot follow
//               that rule and say so at the point of use: the names,
//               addresses, build time and call stack, which are text;
//               the request code, the lottery type and the string-list
//               type, which are code bytes with a named range; the
//               character name in CGRequestIP and GCRequestedIP, which
//               stops at the ten their factory maxima budget; and
//               CGCrashReport's build time and fault address, which
//               write() requires to be exactly 19 and 10 bytes.
//
//               Findings. Each is stated as a test that fails once the
//               packet is fixed, except where noted:
//
//               - GCReconnect::getPacketSize() counts a pc-type byte
//                 that write() never emits and read() never consumes,
//                 so the declared body is one byte longer than the
//                 body sent. The member behind it is never written,
//                 never read and never initialised, so getPCType() on
//                 any GCReconnect returns whatever the storage held.
//               - CGRequestIP's name is bounded nowhere - not in the
//                 setter, not in write(), and not in read(), which
//                 takes the full 255 its count byte carries - while
//                 the factory max budgets ten. An eleven-byte name
//                 declares and emits a body past the buffer the
//                 receiver sizes from that max.
//               - CGRequestIP::read leaves the name the packet already
//                 holds untouched when the count byte is zero, so a
//                 packet read into twice keeps the first name while
//                 write() emitted none.
//               - GCRequestedIP's name is bounded the same way: the
//                 setter, write() and read() all take more than the
//                 ten its factory max budgets.
//               - GCGoodsList::addGoodsInfo is unbounded and write()
//                 narrows the count to a BYTE before testing it
//                 against MAX_GOODS_LIST, so 256 records wrap the
//                 count to zero while write() still emits every one of
//                 them.
//               - A record's option count wraps the same way: the list
//                 is unbounded and the count is narrowed to a BYTE
//                 with no test at all, while GoodsInfo::getPacketMaxSize
//                 budgets 255 options.
//               - GCGoodsList::read appends to the listing the packet
//                 already holds instead of replacing it, so a packet
//                 read into twice declares and writes both listings.
//               - CGRequestInfo::read takes a code byte it never
//                 compares against REQUEST_INFO_MAX, the one value its
//                 own header names.
//               - CGLotterySelect::read takes a type byte it never
//                 compares against TYPE_MAX, the three its own header
//                 names.
//               - CGTypeStringList::read takes a type byte it never
//                 compares against the three StringType values its own
//                 header names.
//               - CGCrashReport::write admits an empty OS, call stack
//                 and message and emits each as a bare zero-length
//                 word, while read() refuses a zero length on all
//                 three: the body write() produces cannot be read
//                 back.
//               - Twelve of the eighteen leave at least one member the
//                 default constructor never sets, so a packet sent
//                 without every setter called puts indeterminate bytes
//                 on the wire. The poisoned-storage pin at the end of
//                 the file asserts today's split.
//
//               Four findings are recorded here rather than tested,
//               because reaching them is undefined behaviour or has no
//               observable wire effect:
//
//               - GCGoodsList::popGoodsInfo takes front() off a list
//                 it never checks for emptiness, and the packet
//                 exposes no count or emptiness getter, so a reader
//                 that does not already know how many records arrived
//                 has no safe way to drain it.
//               - GCGoodsList::addGoodsInfo accepts a null record;
//                 getPacketSize() then follows it, while write()
//                 bounds it through Assert().
//               - CGCrashReport::write bounds its two fixed-width
//                 fields through Assert(), which appends to
//                 assertion_failed.log in the working directory before
//                 it throws.
//               - CGPortCheck is registered on the game server's
//                 client-facing dispatch table, but it is a
//                 DatagramPacket: DatagramPacket::read(SocketInputStream&)
//                 throws by design, so the registration can only be
//                 served over UDP. Its handler reads the sender
//                 address out of the datagram header, not out of the
//                 body pinned here.
