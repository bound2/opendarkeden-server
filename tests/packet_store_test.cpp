// Filename    : packet_store_test.cpp
// Description : Golden byte fixtures, loopback round trips and size
//               pins for the packets a client and a game server
//               exchange over a shop counter: the player-run stores
//               that stand in a zone, the NPC shops, the item stash
//               and the pet stash.
//
//               The set is taken from the code that sends them: the
//               store, shop and stash handlers under
//               src/server/gameserver/handler (CGStoreOpen,
//               CGStoreClose, CGStoreSign, CGDisplayItem,
//               CGUndisplayItem, CGBuyStoreItem, CGRequestStoreInfo,
//               CGShopRequestList, CGShopRequestBuy,
//               CGShopRequestSell, CGStashList, CGStashDeposit,
//               CGStashWithdraw, CGStashRequestBuy, CGMouseToStash,
//               CGStashToMouse, CGDepositPet, CGWithdrawPet), the GC
//               packets those handlers construct, and the three quest
//               actions that answer a shop NPC (ActionBuy, ActionSell,
//               ActionStashSell). Thirty-six packets, each with the
//               reason it is here:
//
//               CGStoreOpen      the player opens and closes the store
//               CGStoreClose     stall their character stands in.
//               CGStoreSign      and names it; the sign is the one
//                                free-text field in the family.
//               CGDisplayItem    the player puts an item in the stall
//               CGUndisplayItem  window at a price, and takes it back.
//               CGBuyStoreItem   a passer-by buys one of those items.
//               CGRequestStoreInfo  and asks what a stall holds; an
//                                owner id of zero asks about their own.
//
//               GCMyStoreInfo    the owner's view of their own stall:
//                                the whole record, open or not.
//               GCOtherStoreInfo a passer-by's view, which stops at the
//                                open flag when the stall is closed.
//               GCAddStoreItem   one item appearing in a stall window,
//               GCRemoveStoreItem  and one leaving it.
//
//               CGShopRequestList  the client asks an NPC for a rack,
//               CGShopRequestBuy   buys a count of one rack slot,
//               CGShopRequestSell  and offers an item back.
//
//               GCShopList       the rack itself: up to twenty slots,
//                                each with its option list, plus the
//                                market conditions and the shop kind.
//               GCShopListMysterious  the same rack for a mysterious
//                                shop, which shows only class and type.
//               GCShopBought     what the NPC took off the player.
//               GCShopBuyOK      what the player got, with the money
//               GCShopBuyFail    left; and why they got nothing.
//               GCShopSellOK     the price the NPC paid, and the
//               GCShopSellFail   refusal.
//               GCShopSold       the broadcast that a rack slot is
//                                gone.
//               GCShopVersion    the per-rack version stamps a client
//                                caches its racks against.
//               GCShopMarketCondition  a price move on its own.
//
//               CGStashList      the client asks for the stash,
//               CGStashDeposit   pays money in and takes money out,
//               CGStashWithdraw
//               CGStashRequestBuy  and asks to rent another rack.
//               CGMouseToStash   the cursor puts an item into a stash
//               CGStashToMouse   slot and takes one back out.
//               GCStashList      the stash itself: three racks of
//                                twenty, each slot with its option list
//                                and the sub-items in a belt.
//               GCStashSell      the price the stash keeper offered.
//
//               CGDepositPet     the pet half of the same counter,
//               CGWithdrawPet    addressed by stash index.
//               GCPetStashList   the twenty pet slots, occupied or not.
//               GCPetStashVerify the one-byte answer to either request.
//
//               Deliberately excluded:
//
//               No packet in this family reads or writes the
//               encrypter. The nineteen src/Core sources that call
//               readEncrypt or writeEncrypt are CGAddMouseToZone,
//               CGAddZoneToInventory, CGAddZoneToMouse, CGAttack,
//               CGDissectionCorpse, CGDropMoney, CGMove,
//               CGNPCAskAnswer, CGPickupMoney, CGSkillToInventory,
//               CGSkillToObject, CGSkillToSelf, CGSkillToTile,
//               CGUseItemFromGear, CGUseItemFromInventory,
//               CGUsePotionFromInventory, GCAddItemToZone,
//               GCMoveError and GCMoveOK, all pinned at encrypt codes
//               0..5 by tests/packet_encrypter_test.cpp, and none of
//               the thirty-six derives from one of them: every class
//               here extends Packet directly. So each golden is
//               recorded at code 0 and its test also asserts the bytes
//               do not vary with the code - adopting the encrypter
//               fails loudly instead of silently voiding the pin.
//
//               Already pinned elsewhere, so the packets the same
//               handlers also send are not repeated here: GCCannotAdd,
//               GCDeleteandPickUpOK, GCCreateItem
//               (packet_inventory_test.cpp), GCDeleteObject
//               (packet_zone_scan_test.cpp), GCModifyInformation
//               (packet_combat_test.cpp), GCNoticeEvent
//               (packet_quest_war_test.cpp), GCSystemMessage
//               (packet_chat_test.cpp),
//               GCNPCResponse (packet_guild_test.cpp). The records
//               these packets embed are pinned too: StoreInfo and
//               StoreOutlook in packet_zone_scan_test.cpp, PCItemInfo
//               and PetInfo in packet_gameserver_handshake_test.cpp,
//               SubItemInfo there and in packet_trade_test.cpp. They
//               appear here only as the contents of a packet, so the
//               offsets around them are pinned as well.
//
//               GCShopList already had a frame-size pin in
//               packet_roundtrip_test.cpp but no golden; it gets one
//               here.
//
//               There is no GCBuyStoreItem answer to write down: the
//               buy handler answers with GCMyStoreInfo,
//               GCRemoveStoreItem and GCShopSellOK. Every one of the
//               thirty-six has a registered factory in
//               tests/ratchet/factory_registrations.txt and at least
//               one sender outside src/Core.
//
//               Each packet gets three pins (STORE_PACKET_TESTS):
//
//               - a loopback round trip through the real socket and
//                 stream classes, comparing every getter;
//               - the body bytes against tests/golden/<Name>.code0.hex;
//               - getPacketSize() against the byte count write()
//                 actually emits, and against the factory's
//                 getPacketMaxSize(). writePacket() puts
//                 getPacketSize() on the wire BEFORE calling write(),
//                 so a disagreement is not a wrong length, it is a
//                 stream that never resynchronises; and the receiving
//                 side sizes its read buffer from the factory max, so a
//                 body that outgrows it is a truncated packet, not a
//                 caught error.
//
//               GCMyStoreInfo and GCOtherStoreInfo get those pins
//               written out by hand: they hold their record by pointer
//               and need a fixture that owns it.
//
//               Extra goldens cover the branches one fixture cannot:
//               the item-bearing records are written with and without
//               an option list (.nooptions on GCAddStoreItem,
//               GCShopList, GCShopBought, GCShopBuyOK, GCStashList),
//               the list packets are written with nothing in them
//               (.empty on GCShopList, GCShopListMysterious,
//               GCStashList, GCPetStashList), a stall is written
//               closed to its owner and to a passer-by (.closed on
//               GCMyStoreInfo and GCOtherStoreInfo, which are the two
//               halves of StoreInfo::write's toOther branch), an empty
//               stall window (.noitem on GCAddStoreItem) and a pet slot
//               holding a record with no pet in it (.petnone on
//               GCPetStashList, PetInfo's own early return). The empty
//               sign gets a golden too (.nosign on CGStoreSign), a bare
//               zero length byte that reads back as an empty stall name.
//
//               Fixture values are distinct per field and >= 128 in
//               every byte the width allows. Three groups cannot follow
//               that rule and say so at the point of use: the stall
//               sign and the pet nickname, which are text; the rack,
//               slot and pet-type bytes a read() uses to index a fixed
//               array or to select a branch; and GCShopVersion's rack
//               type, which selects one of three version stamps.
//
//               The write/read disagreements this set found are fixed,
//               and the bounds section at the end pins what each one
//               produces now:
//
//               - GCShopBuyFail declares the fail code and the
//                 four-byte amount it sends behind the NPC id, and its
//                 factory max budgets all three, where the size and the
//                 max counted the id alone and every refusal overran
//                 the buffer sized for it by five bytes.
//               - CGStoreSign's sign goes through the de::wire helpers
//                 at the 80 its factory max budgets, refused past that
//                 in the setter as well, so its length byte cannot
//                 wrap; an empty sign is admitted, so the bare zero
//                 length byte write() emits reads back.
//               - StoreInfo cuts its sign at the 80 its max size
//                 budgets, the way StoreOutlook does, and bounds it
//                 there on the wire, so a full stall hits the
//                 GCMyStoreInfo and GCOtherStoreInfo maxima exactly.
//               - GCShopBought, GCShopBuyOK, GCShopList and GCStashList
//                 hold their option lists to MAX_ITEM_OPTION_NUM, the
//                 widest an item carries, in the adders, the setters,
//                 write() and read(), and their factory maxima budget
//                 that instead of 255 options.
//               - The same four replace the list a packet already holds
//                 on every read instead of appending to it, as
//                 PCItemInfo::read does.
//               - GCPetStashList carries the twenty slots and nothing
//                 else, which is what the client's own reader takes:
//                 the code byte no sender could deliver is gone, and
//                 the factory max no longer budgets one.
//               - GCStashList's sub-item count for each slot is the
//                 list the records come from, held to the eight the max
//                 budgets, so a sub-item added through getSubItems() is
//                 counted, declared and sent.
//               - GCMyStoreInfo and GCOtherStoreInfo start with an
//                 empty record pointer and refuse in getPacketSize()
//                 and write() rather than follow it.
//               - Every one of the thirty-six initialises every member
//                 its write() emits, pinned over poisoned storage.
//                 CGStoreOpen, CGStoreClose and CGStashRequestBuy are
//                 not in that list because their body is empty, and
//                 GCMyStoreInfo and GCOtherStoreInfo because writing
//                 one over poisoned storage reaches the record pointer,
//                 which gets its own pin.
//
//               Three findings are recorded here rather than fixed,
//               because reaching them is undefined behaviour or has no
//               observable wire effect:
//
//               - GCShopList::read, GCShopListMysterious::read and
//                 GCStashList::read index their fixed slot arrays with
//                 a rack or slot byte taken straight off the wire and
//                 never compared against SHOP_RACK_INDEX_MAX,
//                 STASH_RACK_MAX or STASH_INDEX_MAX, so a peer can
//                 write past the end of the packet. Every fixture here
//                 stays in range for that reason.
//               - GCShopBuyFail::read takes its code byte without
//                 checking it against GC_SHOP_BUY_FAIL_MAX, and the
//                 constructor's own default is that very sentinel, so
//                 an untouched packet announces a code no branch of the
//                 client handles.
//               - GCPetStashList::read overwrites a slot without
//                 freeing what it held and the destructor frees the
//                 slot record but not the PetInfo inside it, so both a
//                 reused packet and a delivered one leak the pet.
